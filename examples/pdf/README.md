# PDF to Markdown Conversion Example

This example demonstrates how to use `docling` to read a PDF file, process it, and export it to Markdown.

## Usage

To run the example, execute the following command from this directory:

```bash
python convert.py
```

This will read the `2206.01062.pdf` file from the `tests/data/pdf` directory, process it using `docling`, and print the resulting Markdown to the console.
